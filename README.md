This repository contains an AI speech-to-image pipeline. It was constructed by piping the output of Deepgram's speech-to-text API into Stable Diffusion's text-to image API. Below, you'll find descriptions of each of the files and folders within this repository. However, if you'd like to see a video-tutorial and demo of this code, check out the following video:
