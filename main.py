The code in `deepgram_inference` will transcribe all
files in `directory` that end with `mimetype`.

(Starter-code default: Transcribe all mp3 files in ./audios)

mimetype = 'mp3'
audio_directory = './audios'
transcript_directory = './deepgram_output'


# API Keys go here. Or, you can set them up as 
# environment variables.
deepgram_key = 'ğŸ”‘ğŸ”‘ğŸ”‘ Your key here ğŸ”‘ğŸ”‘ğŸ”‘'
stable_key = 'ğŸ”‘ğŸ”‘ğŸ”‘ Your key here ğŸ”‘ğŸ”‘ğŸ”‘'


'''
This function takes the videos in `vids`, extracts their audio as .mp3 files,
and then passes those mp3 files through a Speech-to-Image pipeline built
with Deepgram and Stable Diffusion.

To see the images, check out the "output" entry in Stable Diffusion's 
Responses, which will be printed to the console.
